## Hi, everyone! 👋🏼

My name is Chris. I am 29 years old & a passionate open-source developer who loves to travel the world, learn about new cultures & eat good food. When I am not traveling the world, I live in Los Angeles, CA.

### A few highlights

- [Stacks](https://github.com/stacksjs/stacks) - A full-stack framework powered by Vite. _Deeply inspired by Laravel & Vue.js._
- [Open Web](https://github.com/ow3org) - A decentralized community that develops progressive, open web standards, and stacks.
- [Meema](https://github.com/meemalabs) - Media & file management with ease—front & backend

### Current Focus

Aside from core framework development, these are the stacks we will finish next:

- [Table](https://github.com/stacksjs/table) (Data tables with ease)
- [Command Palette](https://github.com/stacksjs/command-palette) (`cmd + k` for the web)
- [Date Picker](https://github.com/stacksjs/date-picker) (Beautiful, modern date picker)
- [File Manager](https://github.com/stacksjs/file-manager) (Build your own file manager—like Dropbox or Google Drive)
- [Image](https://github.com/stacksjs/image) (Modern image experience)
- [Video](https://github.com/stacksjs/video) (Modern video experience)
- [Audio](https://github.com/stacksjs/audio) (Modern audio experience)
